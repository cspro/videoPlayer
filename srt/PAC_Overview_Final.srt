1
00:00:00,196 --> 00:00:06,376
Every student brings
something unique to the world.

2
00:00:06,376 --> 00:00:12,846
Their interests, their
strengths, their dreams.

3
00:00:16,456 --> 00:00:18,376
Each one of them
represents a future

4
00:00:19,516 --> 00:00:21,896
that really can change
life for all of us.

5
00:00:21,966 --> 00:00:25,876
And when it comes
to their education.

6
00:00:27,646 --> 00:00:29,276
They deserve our very best.

7
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,716
So they can achieve
their very best.

8
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:38,346
At Pearson, that's what
we've stood for since 1836.

9
00:00:39,236 --> 00:00:40,976
To empower students
to make the most

10
00:00:40,976 --> 00:00:44,376
of their learning experience and
realize their full potential,

11
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:47,396
we must first be able to assess
their educational journey.

12
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:48,676
Confidently.

13
00:00:49,656 --> 00:00:50,826
With clarity and focus.

14
00:00:51,536 --> 00:00:54,076
At any step, and at
every step along the way.

15
00:00:54,846 --> 00:00:56,406
That's what our assessments
deliver

16
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:58,876
to the educational
institutions and leaders

17
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:00,766
with whom we partner
across the globe.

18
00:01:01,466 --> 00:01:03,596
Clarity, flexibility, and focus.

19
00:01:04,556 --> 00:01:07,106
From assessments of
day-to-day and yearly learning

20
00:01:07,206 --> 00:01:09,166
to ensure college
and career readiness,

21
00:01:09,706 --> 00:01:10,876
To clinical assessments

22
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:14,006
that help us understand why
students struggle in or out

23
00:01:14,006 --> 00:01:17,636
of the classroom, To developing
customized testing content

24
00:01:17,636 --> 00:01:19,616
that aligns with your
distinct standards,

25
00:01:20,586 --> 00:01:21,966
To enhancing technology,

26
00:01:22,786 --> 00:01:24,816
fostering English
language proficiency,

27
00:01:25,436 --> 00:01:28,426
modernizing assessment
tools, and exploring new ways

28
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:31,356
to meet the needs of learners
with cognitive disabilities,

29
00:01:32,216 --> 00:01:35,136
Pearson leads the way, and
has for more than a century.

30
00:01:35,776 --> 00:01:37,986
We've written the history
of educational assessments,

31
00:01:38,206 --> 00:01:39,766
and we are shaping its future.

32
00:01:40,656 --> 00:01:42,356
With capabilities
that are global,

33
00:01:42,566 --> 00:01:43,926
but a delivery that's local.

34
00:01:44,716 --> 00:01:47,126
Like you, we know that
it's about outcomes

35
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:50,006
and putting each student
in a position to succeed

36
00:01:50,006 --> 00:01:51,346
in learning, and in life.

37
00:01:52,166 --> 00:01:54,196
We understand that
no goal is too big,

38
00:01:54,246 --> 00:01:55,986
and no project is too small.

39
00:01:56,086 --> 00:01:59,286
And we know that when it comes
to the future of your students,

40
00:01:59,646 --> 00:02:01,066
you need a partner
you can trust.

41
00:02:01,616 --> 00:02:03,986
A partner who understands
the power of potential

42
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:06,706
and that everyone's educational
journey is different.

43
00:02:07,296 --> 00:02:09,256
A partner who believes
in your students,

44
00:02:09,536 --> 00:02:12,266
who knows the positive impact
they can have on your economy,

45
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:15,656
and who is dedicated to helping
you achieve the best possible

46
00:02:15,656 --> 00:02:18,246
outcomes no matter how
challenging the economic

47
00:02:18,246 --> 00:02:19,196
environment may be.

48
00:02:19,196 --> 00:02:20,786
Because in the end,
We're always learning.
